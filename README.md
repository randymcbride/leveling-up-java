A sandbox to let me play with code. Each package in src/test/java/com/rmcbride/levelingupjava contains a junit test
file that walks you through a self contained lesson. Just start with the first test method and move down reading the
comments and code. You can even run the tests if you like. Each package should also inlude a README that explains that
lesson in greater detail.
